# Spire PDF paper tray selection issue

This sample code demonstrates paper tray selection when printing a PDF document, using Spire.Pdf.

See [issue](https://www.e-iceblue.com/forum/topic10321.html).

With my home printer (HP LaserJet P2055dn) this does not work, however with the printer in the office, paper tray selection works fine.
I suppose that the issue is with the driver of my printer, not with Spire PDF's implementation.
